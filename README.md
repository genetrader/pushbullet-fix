# Pushbullet Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)

A community-maintained version of the Pushbullet Chrome extension updated to work with Manifest V3.  This extension REQUIRES you have an account already with Pushbullet.com and I am NOT affiliated with them and you can sign up when you open the extension.

IF YOU LIKE THIS EXTENSION I HAVE BUILT A LOT MORE.  JUST SAY THANKS, GIVE IT A STAR AND I WILL START TO COMPILE MY DIRECTORY OF VIBE-CODED CHROME EXTENSIONS AND SHARE THEM!  I HAVE A BUNCH - THANKS.

## Differences from Original

### Technical Changes for Manifest V3:
- Converted background scripts to service workers
- Replaced `chrome.browserAction` with `chrome.action` API
- Updated `chrome.extension` APIs to modern equivalents
- Added polyfills for `XMLHttpRequest` and `localStorage` in service workers
- Modified context menu implementation to use `onClicked` events
- Implemented message passing between UI pages and service worker

### Files Added:
- `background.js` - Service worker entry point

- `page-v3.js` - Updated page script for UI communication
- `context-menu-v3.js` - Updated context menu implementation

## Known Issues
